# Week 7 Research and Requirements Task

## Project Outline
My area of interest for my project is creating a virtual instrument that can be played by a bespoke user(s). 
Potential problems solved by this artefact include:
- Struggling with unfamiliar MIDI controllers or other musical interfaces
- Only one person being able to control a virtual instrument at any given time
- Not having access to an intuitive tool for learning harmonic theory

## Initial Research


# Project research
Replace this text. Briefly discuss examples of some current or historic related projects (include references in bibliography below).

## Proposed sources
Replace this text. Note: please use APA referencing as standard.

# Project development
The project will be an application that allows someone with a controller to play melodies and build chords using synthesis.

## What do you anticipate them to hear?
They will hear a fairly basic Synth that responds to the users input controller data.

## How will they interact with your software?
They will interact with my software by using the controllers various buttons, triggers and analog sticks.
- May also feature a GUI with customizable synth parameters

## What unique features does your software offer them?
My software will provide a new interface for interacting with virtual instruments, circumventing MIDI controllers.

# List the input sources you will be using

For example:
- Real-time input for a controller
  -  Possible audio file input
  -  Possible Manual GUI input
   

# List the output sources you will be using

For example:

- Real-time audio output
 - Possible Control Data Output

# List how you will enable real-time control

For example:

- MAX MSP GUI
- Human Interface Object in Max MSP
