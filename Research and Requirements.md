# Week 7 Research and Requirements Task

## Project Outline
My area of interest for my project is creating a virtual instrument that can be played by a bespoke user(s). 
Potential problems solved by this artefact include:
- A lack of familiar and accessible digital musical instrument interfaces
- Only one person being able to control a virtual instrument at any given time
- Not having access to an intuitive tool for learning harmonic theory

# Initial Research

## Organistrum 
A predecessor to the hurdie-gurdie that required two people to play it. 
One person cranked the instrument whilst the other person used triggers to fret the strings.
This could inform my design of a multiplayer instrument by having one person responsible for the volume
of the instruments notes and chords whilst the other plays the pitches.

## Miranda, E. R., & Wanderley, M. M. (2006). New Digital Musical Instruments: Control and Interaction Beyond the Keyboard
This book is a comprehensive guide to unique music controllers. It provides examples of unconventional hardware being mapped to
different parameters of a virtual instrument which directly parallels my area of interest.

## Wanderley, M. M., & Battier, M. (2000). "Gestural Control of Music."
This paper investigates how gesture based controllers can affect digital musical instruments in real time. The paper
discusses designs based around splitting typical instrument interfaces in two when designing virtual instruments:
 -  Gestural Interface: what is being done by a user physically to control an instrument
 -  Sound Generation: what acoustic mechanism in the instrument is creating a sound
Whilst typical acoustic instruments have there gestural interface directly affect the sound generation, DMI's can
split these and map them to whatever interface and gesture is desired.

## Frid, Emma. (2019). Accessible Digital Musical Instruments—A Review of Musical Interfaces in Inclusive Music Practice.  
This paper details digital musical instrument design philosophies surrounding accessibility.
This paper could be crutial in providing alternative solutions in solving the accesibility problem of
DMI interface design. Furthermore, providing examples of interfaces the are sucessful in providing
an accesible user experience may provide a framework for me to design my instrument sucessfully.


# Project Requirements - Jobs To Be Done

## Target Users
 - Primary User: Experimental  musicians and hobbyists predisposed to unique DMI design
 - Secondary User: Gamers wishing to interact with music through a familiar interface

## Primary Jobs 
 - Create musical chords and melodies using a digital musical instrument
 - Play the musical instrument with a program designed to convert controller data into musical input
 - Provide intuitive, accessible and responsive gestural controls to be converted into musical input.

## Secondary Jobs
 - Provide multiple users a medium of interacting simultaneously with an instrument in real time
 - Provide responsive haptic or visual feedback to reinforce successful gestural controls
 - Provide a means for the secondary user to grasp harmonic theory using an interface they are familiar with

## Potential Pain Points
 - The sound created by each individual controller input is irreflective of the gestural control used to create it
 - The sound created by the DMI itself is unpleasant, out of tune etc
 - The instrument is inaccessible to users without musical knowledge
 - The instrument is inflexible for users with musical knowledge

## Potential Solutions
 - Ensure every parameter is mapped to a controller input capable of fully and intuitively controlling it
    - Analog stick for pitch control? Triggers for octave control? Buttons for envelope/percussive control?
 - Use my own experience in DSP and Sound Design to provide every user with a synthesizer with timbral and harmonic merit
 - Provide fully customizable scale and pitch options to account for the musical knowledge of every user
    - Pentatonic scale mapped to analog stick direction for secondary user
    - Fully modular analog direction pitch mapping and root note customization for primary users
