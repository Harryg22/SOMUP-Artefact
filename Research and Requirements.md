# Week 7 Research and Requirements Task

## Project Outline
My area of interest for my project is creating a virtual instrument that can be played by a bespoke user(s). 
Potential problems solved by this artefact include:
- Struggling with unfamiliar MIDI controllers or other musical interfaces
- Only one person being able to control a virtual instrument at any given time
- Not having access to an intuitive tool for learning harmonic theory

# Initial Research

## Organistrum 
A predecessor to the hurdie-gurdie that required two people to play it. 
One person cranked the instrument whilst the other person used triggers to fret the strings.
This could inform my design of a multiplayer instrument by having one person responsible for the volume
of the instruments notes and chords whilst the other plays the pitches.

## Miranda, E. R., & Wanderley, M. M. (2006). New Digital Musical Instruments: Control and Interaction Beyond the Keyboard
This book is a comprehensive guide to unique music controllers. It provides examples of unconventional hardware being mapped to
different parameters of a virtual instrument which directly parallels my area of interest.

## Wanderley, M. M., & Battier, M. (2000). "Gestural Control of Music."
This paper investigates how gesture based controllers can affect digital musical instruments in real time. The paper
discusses designs based around splitting typical instrument interfaces in two when designing virtual instruments:
 -  Gestural Interface: what is being done by a user physically to control an instrument
 -  Sound Generation: what acoustic mechanism in the instrument is creating a sound
Whilst typical acoustic instruments have there sound generation directly affected by the gestural interface, DMI's can
split these and map them to whatever interface is desired.
